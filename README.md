# TDD With XUNIT

## What is TDD?

TDD stands for Test Driven Development. It is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. The developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

## What is XUNIT?

XUnit is the collective name for several unit testing frameworks that derive their structure and functionality from Smalltalk's SUnit. SUnit, designed by Kent Beck in 1998, was written in a highly structured object-oriented style, which lent easily to contemporary languages such as Java and C#. This is why many of the XUnit frameworks are written in Java or C#.
